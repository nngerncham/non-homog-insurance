# Using Non-homogenous Markov Chains to calculate when we (are expected) to die

##### By a dying CS student (Nawat)

<!-- _header: Disclaimer -->

## Disclaimer!

The presentation is based on *simplified numeric* results!

The actual math behind this topic is a lot more complicated than I expected, so a few things might be over-simplified.

## Disclaimer! Part 2

Nawat is in fact not dying and the person presenting is definitely not an evil clone.
